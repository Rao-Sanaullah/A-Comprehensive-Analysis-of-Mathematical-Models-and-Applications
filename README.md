# A Comprehensive Analysis of Mathematical Models and Applications


This repository discusses Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and their mathematical models, which simulate the behavior of neurons through the generation of spikes. These models are used to improve the accuracy of the network's outputs and have potential applications in various fields. However, implementing SNNs can pose certain challenges, especially when it comes to determining the most suitable SNN model for classification tasks requiring high accuracy and low-performance loss. To address this issue, a study was conducted to compare the performance, behavior, and spike generation of different SNN models using the same inputs and neurons. The results of the study provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this area, highlighting the importance of comparing different models to determine the most effective one.

# A Dataset

Datasets play a crucial role in the development and evaluation of machine learning models, including spiking neural networks. The synthetic dataset used in this study was designed to have two classes that are easily separable by a linear classifier, which allows for a straightforward evaluation of the performance of different models. Additionally, the synthetic dataset is more transparent in terms of the underlying data generation process, which can help in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different models.
